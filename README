What's this? 
------------

This little input method plugin can come in very handy if enjoy using 
all those unicode characters that can finally be taken for granted 
(it is truly absurd that there's no proper way for typing those chars)

This file allows you to reference a small selected subset 
(the greek alphabet + some chars i always need) by name. 
Here's a demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01s1mUdzMw4



How to install: 
---------------
1. Copy this to ~/Library/Input Methods/
2. Go to System Preferences → Language → Input Methods
   Make sure you enable the "UnicodeByNames" Plugin
   and set a quick short cut for switching languages. 
3. Logout and back in (no idea why this is necessary)
4. Fire up textedit, switch to the new language and type 
   arrow followed by a space, you should get a neat little 
   menu from which you can select the arrow you want. 

This should work in most applications, sometimes the character menu 
will be at the lower left corner (e.g. in textmate). 




Problems: 
---------
If you grab the file from github it might look a bit funky. 
That shouldn't be problem though, 
just ensure that when editing the file you load and save with 
encoding "utf 16 little endian", 
When you want to view it in your browser use View → Encoding → UTF-16
p.s. To make the confusion complete this readme is stored as UTF-8!
